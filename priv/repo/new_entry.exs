Journal.add_entry("Off to a Good Start", "I started work this week at Salt Lake Community College (SLCC). Going in, I was not entirely sure what to expect, but it seems like what I will be doing matches well with my expectations. There are several SLCC campuses and many of them have community gardens, food pantries, or both. My role is to build the capacity of these resources and to recruit volunteers. I will only be here for a year, so the goal is to make these projects as self-sustaining as possible so that they function for long after I leave. I am working with two other VISTAs. One is a former SLCC student who has helped out with a pantry and garden in the past. The other VISTA is from Utah and worked with FEMA Corps last year, but, like me, is new to SLCC. On Monday, I drove to work, passing a sign that read 'CAMP IN THE MOUNTAINS NOT THE LEFT LANE'. I arrived bright and early at 8 AM. Most of the week was spent researching various food banks, food pantries, and community gardens in the area. I made appointments to visit several of them in order to learn more about what they do and to get some ideas as to how to improve our own facilities. I also spent time chatting with my co-workers and Isaac, a student who has put a ton of work into the gardens. We discussed several ideas for the gardens and pantries. I got a sense of what is and isn't doable. Isaac has a lot of great ideas for projects to improve the gardens and is very enthusiastic about them. I look forward to being able to implement some of them. I spent the evenings after work exploring downtown Salt Lake City. On Monday, I biked in and got a glimpse of several parks and commercial areas, as well as Temple Square, of course. On Tuesday, I got dinner with a former roommate's brother at the Vertical Diner, an all-vegan restaurant that was disappointingly just one story. On Wednesday, I checked out the Sugar House farmer's market and then bought a bike from someone in Park City with a hope of reselling it. It was neat to see what the ski resort looks like without snow covering it! On Thursday, I went for a jog around the neighborhood, perhaps not the best activity for summertime in a desert. However, I then enjoyed some live music at an event across the street from my house and a nice conversation with Ian, one of my roommates. Friday night I took it easy and stayed in. I watched Poverty, Inc, a documentary about global poverty that 'examines the rise of charity as a multibillion-dollar poverty industry'. On Saturday, I hung out with Adam. We first checked out the Downtown Farmer's Market in Pioneer Park. It was the biggest and best farmer's market I've ever been to! We spent nearly two hours there and didn't even get to see every stand. I got a lot of produce shopping out of the way. We then went bouldering in Little Cottonwood Canyon, my first time doing so outdoors. We had a great time and ultimately tried to climb as far up the mountain as we could. We returned to Adam's house where I engaged in a four-hour long discussion with Adam's roommate, John. I finally got home around 12:30 AM and fell asleep after a physically and mentally exhausting day.", "07/22/18")
